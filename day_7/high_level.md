## Ceasar Cipher

For the Ceasar Cipher I first need to have an array of all the letters in the alphabet in order.  This will be my starting reference point for when input is received.  Then I will need to create a function that takes exactly two arguments in as parameters. The first argument will be a string passed in as a variable.  The second parameter will need to be an integer.

The function will need to break the string down into individual characters.  Those characters will need to be converted to the index position of the their respective value based on how the alphabet is ordered.  Then the parameter that was passed in will need to be added (or subtracted) to the indexed position of the individual character values. If the string passed in starts with A then `'A' = 0` with a parameter of `3` then it will need to be saved as `3`.  The next part of the function will have to be to look up what letter is at index position of 4 and return that value (`'C'`).  

Things seemingly get complex when dealing with the end of the alphabet because any index number above 25 would lead to a return value of `nil` because the alphabet only has indexes of 0-25.  This can be countered by simply returning a new array wherein any index over 25 is made to be subtracted by 26 to find the proper index. After the calculation has been made to the original index position to find the 'encrypted index position', something like  `if x > 25 x -= 26 else x = x` can be run and stored in a separate array.  This absolutely will break down if the integer passed in as an argument is greater than 25.  If I really wanted to get frisky I'm sure we could run some math wherein any number over 25 is reallocated to a more workable figure in the 0-25 range, but I digress.

Ok at this point we have all the string, broken down into individual characters, index position found, X number of index positions added (or subtracted), found the index position of the new integer, and converted back to the value associated with that index position.  To return it back to one beautiful non-sensical string the `.join` method will have to be used **AFTER** all that has been completed and we should get an output of an encrypted message.
